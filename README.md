# AutomationPDFFormFillUp

This is a replication of an automation project I completed for a Global Investment Bank.  
<sub> Note: Due to company policy, I cannot provide the original program and PDF template. </sub>

Task: Given a excel spradsheet of any amount of data rows, automate the fill up of a template PDF form by a click of a button.

Features:   
•	Portable  
•	Accessible within a shared network drive  
•	Scalable (number of data rows)  
•	Saves forms with customisable names and in a user-specified directory  

**Project Takeaways**  
•	Positive learningattitude/'Never say never' attitude: Prior to this project, I knew nothing about VBA Excel. Nevertheless, I decided to learn it from scratch. This process of self learning and trial and error proved to be challenging given the tight deadline. Fortunately, I successfully implemented project within a working time of week, ahead of deadline.  
•	Interdisciplinary Communication: At the beginning, I had to understand my client's requirements of the project, generate technical solutions and communicate them in a way that they could understand. (As they were from a non-technical background) This process continued in the subsequent project meetings.  
•	Be prepared for adaptation and reworking of code: With each project meeting, I was routinely asked to make additions to the program.  



**Instructions**  
1. Download the .zip file and export it anywhere on your computer  
2. Select the location of the exported PDF Template file   
3. Select the directory location of the 'SavePDFFolder' folder where completed PDFs will be saved in  
4. Click the blue 'Fill Form' button to observe the filling up of the form.
