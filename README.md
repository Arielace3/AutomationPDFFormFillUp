# AutomationPDFFormFillUp

This is a replication* of an automation project completed for a Global Investment Bank.  
  

  

Task: Given a excel spreadsheet of any amount of data rows, automate the fill up of a template PDF form by a click of a button.

Features:   
•	Portable  
•	Accessible within a shared network drive  
•	Scalable (number of data rows)  
•	Saves forms with customisable names and in a user-specified directory  

**Project Takeaways:**  
•	Positive learning attitude/'Never say never' attitude:  
Prior to this project, I knew nothing about VBA Excel. Nevertheless, I decided to learn it from scratch. This process of self learning and trial and error proved to be challenging given the tight deadline. Fortunately, I successfully implemented project within a working time of week, ahead of deadline.  
•	Interdisciplinary Communication:  
At the beginning, I had to understand my client's requirements of the project, generate technical solutions and communicate them in a way that they could understand. (As they were from a non-technical background) This process continued in the subsequent project meetings.  
•	Be prepared for adaptation and reworking of code:  
With each project meeting, I was routinely asked to make additions to the program.
